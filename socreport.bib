                  neurons (i.e., threshold gates), respectively,
                  sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that
                  networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the
                  number of neurons that are needed, computationally
                  more powerful than these other neural network
                  models. A concrete biologically relevant function is
                  exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking
                  neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its
                  parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden
                  units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand,
                  it is known that any function that can be computed
                  by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed
                  by a small network of spiking neurons. This article

                  the field of machine learning, for computer vision
                  in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer)
                  artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most
                  often in a supervised manner using backpropagation.
                  Vast amounts of labeled training examples are
                  required, but the resulting classification accuracy
                  is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans.
                  Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single,
                  static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological
                  neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit
                  information, and the spike times, in addition to the
                  spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs)
                  are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and
                  are arguably the only viable option if one wants to
                  understand how the brain computes at the neuronal
                  description level. The spikes of biological neurons
                  are sparse in time and space, and event-driven.
                  Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules,
                  this makes it easier to build low-power,
                  neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training
                  deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons’
                  transfer function is usually non-differentiable,
                  which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review
                  recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train
                  deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and
                  computational cost. The emerging picture is that
                  SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but
                  the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some
                  tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer
                  operations and are the better candidates to process
                  spatio-temporal data."

                  non-Von Neumann hardware that mimics the brain's

  ABSTRACT =     {Deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) hold the
                  potential for improving the latency and energy
                  efficiency of deep neural networks through
                  data-driven event-based computation. However,
                  training such networks is difficult due to the
                  non-differentiable nature of spike events. In this
                  paper, we introduce a novel technique, which treats
                  the membrane potentials of spiking neurons as
                  differentiable signals, where discontinuities at
                  spike times are considered as noise. This enables an
                  error backpropagation mechanism for deep SNNs that
                  follows the same principles as in conventional deep
                  networks, but works directly on spike signals and
                  membrane potentials. Compared with previous methods
                  relying on indirect training and conversion, our
                  technique has the potential to capture the
                  statistics of spikes more precisely. We evaluate the
                  proposed framework on artificially generated events
                  from the original MNIST handwritten digit benchmark,
                  and also on the N-MNIST benchmark recorded with an
                  event-based dynamic vision sensor, in which the
                  proposed method reduces the error rate by a factor
                  of more than three compared to the best previous
                  SNN, and also achieves a higher accuracy than a
                  conventional convolutional neural network (CNN)
                  trained and tested on the same data. We demonstrate
                  in the context of the MNIST task that thanks to
                  their event-driven operation, deep SNNs (both fully
                  connected and convolutional) trained with our method
                  achieve accuracy equivalent with conventional neural
                  networks. In the N-MNIST example, equivalent
                  accuracy is achieved with about five times fewer
                  computational operations.}

  ABSTRACT =     {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer many advantages
                  over traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs)
                  such as biological plausibility, fast information
                  processing, and energy efficiency. Although SNNs
                  have been used to solve a variety of control tasks
                  using the Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
                  learning rule, existing solutions usually involve
                  hard-coded network architectures solving specific
                  tasks rather than solving different kinds of tasks
                  generally. This results in neglecting one of the
                  biggest advantages of ANNs, i.e., being
                  general-purpose and easy-to-use due to their simple
                  network architecture, which usually consists of an
                  input layer, one or multiple hidden layers and an
                  output layer. This paper addresses the problem by
                  introducing an end-to-end learning approach of
                  spiking neural networks constructed with one hidden
                  layer and reward-modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent
                  Plasticity (R-STDP) synapses in an all-to-all
                  fashion. We use the supervised reward-modulated
                  Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity learning rule to
                  train two different SNN-based sub-controllers to
                  replicate a desired obstacle avoiding and goal
                  approaching behavior, provided by pre-generated
                  datasets. Together they make up a target-reaching
                  controller, which is used to control a simulated
                  mobile robot to reach a target area while avoiding
                  obstacles in its path. We demonstrate the
                  performance and effectiveness of our trained SNNs to
                  achieve target reaching tasks in different unknown
                  scenarios.}

  ABSTRACT =     {Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are fast becoming a
                  promising candidate for brain-inspired neuromorphic
                  computing because of their inherent power efficiency
                  and impressive inference accuracy across several
                  cognitive tasks such as image classification and
                  speech recognition. The recent efforts in SNNs have
                  been focused on implementing deeper networks with
                  multiple hidden layers to incorporate exponentially
                  more difficult functional representations. In this
                  paper, we propose a pre-training scheme using
                  biologically plausible unsupervised learning, namely
                  Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP), in order
                  to better initialize the parameters in multi-layer
                  systems prior to supervised optimization. The
                  multi-layer SNN is comprised of alternating
                  convolutional and pooling layers followed by
                  fully-connected layers, which are populated with
                  leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neurons. We train
                  the deep SNNs in two phases wherein, first,
                  convolutional kernels are pre-trained in a
                  layer-wise manner with unsupervised learning
                  followed by fine-tuning the synaptic weights with
                  spike-based supervised gradient descent
                  backpropagation. Our experiments on digit
                  recognition demonstrate that the STDP-based
                  pre-training with gradient-based optimization
                  provides improved robustness, faster (~2.5 ×)
                  training time and better generalization compared
                  with purely gradient-based training without
                  pre-training.}

  abstract =     {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation, a learning
                  framework for energy-based models. It involves only
                  one kind of neural computation, performed in both
                  the first phase (when the prediction is made) and
                  the second phase of training (after the target or
                  prediction error is revealed). Although this
                  algorithm computes the gradient of an objective
                  function just like Backpropagation, it does not need
                  a special computation or circuit for the second
                  phase, where errors are implicitly propagated.
                  Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with
                  Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive
                  Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of
                  both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient
                  of a well-defined objective function. Because the
                  objective function is defined in terms of local
                  perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium
                  Propagation corresponds to only nudging the
                  prediction (fixed point or stationary distribution)
                  toward a configuration that reduces prediction
                  error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer
                  supervised network, the output units are slightly
                  nudged toward their target in the second phase, and
                  the perturbation introduced at the output layer
                  propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show
                  that the signal “back-propagated” during this second
                  phase corresponds to the propagation of error
                  derivatives and encodes the gradient of the
                  objective function, when the synaptic update
                  corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing
                  dependent plasticity. This work makes it more
                  plausible that a mechanism similar to
                  Backpropagation could be implemented by brains,
                  since leaky integrator neural computation performs
                  both inference and error back-propagation in our
                  model. The only local difference between the two
                  phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or
                  not. We also show experimentally that multi-layer
                  recurrently connected networks with 1, 2, and 3
                  hidden layers can be trained by Equilibrium
                  Propagation on the permutation-invariant MNIST
                  task.}

  abstract = 	 {Backpropagation is almost universally used to train artificial neural networks.  However, there are several reasons that backpropagation could not be plausibly implemented by biological neurons.  Among these are the facts that (1) biological neurons appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients backwards across synapses, and (2) biological “spiking” neurons emit binary signals, whereas back-propagation requires that neurons communicate continuous values between one another.   Recently, Scellier and Bengio [2017], demonstrated an alternative to backpropagation, called Equilibrium Propagation, wherein gradients are implicitly computed by the dynamics of the neural network, so that neurons do not need an internal mechanism for backpropagation of gradients.  This provides an interesting solution to problem (1).  In this paper, we address problem (2) by proposing a way in which Equilibrium Propagation can be implemented with neurons which are constrained to just communicate binary values at each time step.  We show that with appropriate step-size annealing, we can converge to the same fixed-point as a real-valued neural network, and that with predictive coding, we can make this convergence much faster. We demonstrate that the resulting model can be used to train a spiking neural network using the update scheme from Equilibrium propagation.}

  abstract =     {The timing of individual neuronal spikes is
                  essential for biological brains to make fast
                  responses to sensory stimuli. However, conventional
                  artificial neural networks lack the intrinsic
                  temporal coding ability present in biological
                  networks. We propose a spiking neural network model
                  that encodes information in the relative timing of
                  individual neuron spikes. In classification tasks,
                  the output of the network is indicated by the first
                  neuron to spike in the output layer. This temporal
                  coding scheme allows the supervised training of the
                  network with backpropagation, using locally exact
                  derivatives of the postsynaptic spike times with
                  respect to presynaptic spike times. The network
                  operates using a biologically-plausible alpha
                  synaptic transfer function. Additionally, we use
                  trainable synchronisation pulses that provide bias,
                  add flexibility during training and exploit the
                  decay part of the alpha function. We show that such
                  networks can be trained successfully on noisy
                  Boolean logic tasks and on the MNIST dataset encoded
                  in time. The results show that the spiking neural
                  network outperforms comparable spiking models on
                  MNIST and achieves similar quality to fully
                  connected conventional networks with the same
                  architecture. We also find that the spiking network
                  spontaneously discovers two operating regimes,
                  mirroring the accuracy-speed trade-off observed in
                  human decision-making: a slow regime, where a
                  decision is taken after all hidden neurons have
                  spiked and the accuracy is very high, and a fast
                  regime, where a decision is taken very fast but the
                  accuracy is lower. These results demonstrate the
                  computational power of spiking networks with
                  biological characteristics that encode information
                  in the timing of individual neurons. By studying
                  temporal coding in spiking networks, we aim to
                  create building blocks towards energy-efficient and
                  more complex biologically-inspired neural
                  architectures.},

                  great potential for numerous real-world machine
                  learning applications, but performing inference in
                  large CNNs in real-time remains a challenge. We have
                  previously demonstrated that traditional CNNs can be
                  converted into deep spiking neural networks (SNNs),
                  which exhibit similar accuracy while reducing both
                  latency and computational load as a consequence of
                  their data-driven, event-based style of computing.
                  Here we provide a novel theory that explains why
                  this conversion is successful, and derive from it
                  several new tools to convert a larger and more
                  powerful class of deep networks into SNNs. We
                  identify the main sources of approximation errors in
                  previous conversion methods, and propose simple
                  mechanisms to fix these issues. Furthermore, we
                  develop spiking implementations of common CNN
                  operations such as max-pooling, softmax, and
                  batch-normalization, which allow almost loss-less
                  conversion of arbitrary CNN architectures into the
                  spiking domain. Empirical evaluation of different
                  network architectures on the MNIST and CIFAR10
                  benchmarks leads to the best SNN results reported to

ABSTRACT={This article reports on two databases for event-driven object recognition using a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The first, which we call Poker-DVS and is being released together with this article, was obtained by browsing specially made poker card decks in front of a DVS camera for 2–4 s. Each card appeared on the screen for about 20–30 ms. The poker pips were tracked and isolated off-line to constitute the 131-recording Poker-DVS database. The second database, which we call MNIST-DVS and which was released in December 2013, consists of a set of 30,000 DVS camera recordings obtained by displaying 10,000 moving symbols from the standard MNIST 70,000-picture database on an LCD monitor for about 2–3 s each. Each of the 10,000 symbols was displayed at three different scales, so that event-driven object recognition algorithms could easily be tested for different object sizes. This article tells the story behind both databases, covering, among other aspects, details of how they work and the reasons for their creation. We provide not only the databases with corresponding scripts, but also the scripts and data used to generate the figures shown in this article (as Supplementary Material).}

abstract = "The proposed work introduces a neural control strategy for guiding adaptation in spiking neural structures acting as nonlinear controllers in a group of bio-inspired robots which compete in reaching targets in a virtual environment. The neural structures embedded into each agent are inspired by a specific part of the insect brain, namely Central Complex, devoted to detect, learn and memorize visual features for targeted motor control. A reduced-order model of a spiking neuron is used as the basic building block for the neural controller. The control methodology employs bio-inspired, correlation based learning mechanisms like Spike timing dependent plasticity with the addition of a reward/punishment-based method experimentally found in insects. The reference signal for the overall multi-agent control system is imposed by a global reward, which guides motor learning to direct each agent towards specific visual targets. The neural controllers within the agents start from identical conditions: the learning strategy induces each robot to show anticipated targeting actions upon specific visual stimuli. The whole control structure also contributes to make the robots refractory or more sensitive to specific visual stimuli, showing distinct preferences in future choices. This leads to an environmentally induced, targeted motor control, even without a direct communication among the agents, giving robots, while running, the ability to perform adaptation in real-time. Experiments, carried out in a dynamic simulation environment, show the suitability of the proposed approach. Specific performance indexes, like Shannon׳s Entropy, are adopted to quantitatively analyze diversity and specialization within the group."

                  large areas of the brain influencing the synaptic
                  plasticity of the neurons in those regions. We build
                  on this theory to propose a multi-agent learning
                  framework with spiking neurons in the generalized
                  linear model (GLM) formulation as agents, to solve

                  hierarchical fashion, where each spiking agent
                  modulates its firing policy based on local
                  information and a global prediction error, can learn
                  complex action representations to solve RL tasks. We

                  help reduce variance in the learning updates making
